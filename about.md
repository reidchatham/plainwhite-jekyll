Some stuff about me, well, I like a lot of things, but only if they are practical. I enjoy reading books, almost entirely nonfiction unless the fiction has historical or cultural significance. I enjoy nature, and camping and exploring, my version of hiking. I enjoy gardening, and getting in touch with the soil and with the earth. I am a huge fan of music, and play guitar and produce electronic music.
